			<P>When I graduate from college, I would like to follow a dream I've had since I was pretty young. My dream for after college has always been to live on Cape Cod where I grew up and own my own successful bakery. I love to bake and try new recipes, and in a touristy location such as Cape Cod, I think a small quaint bakery could be very popular. Some of my favorite things to bake are apple crisp, donuts, and different styles of cupcakes. I would love to learn how to brew my own blend of coffee as well, seeing that I drink it on a daily basis.</P>

			<P>Being in the Maine Business School, I have learned a lot about entrepreneurship and starting a small business. I hope at some point I will be able to apply my knowledge to starting my own bakery. If the bakery was to grow and become pretty popular, I would also love to expand into catering and creating baked goods for events such as weddings, graduation parties, or any other occasion!</P>
