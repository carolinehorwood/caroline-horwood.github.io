			<P>I graduated from Sandwich High School in 2016. My high school was pretty small, and I was very close with most of the people in my grade.

			<P> In Fall of 2016, I started my freshman year of college at University of Delaware in Newark, DE. My major was hospitality, and as part of my major I had a cooking lab every week where I got to create my own meals in a real restaurant!</P>

			<P> Although I enjoyed my major and made some great friends at University of Delaware, I quickly realized that it was not the right school for me to continue my education at. New England is my home and I realized that I wanted to be back closer to home and attend a school where there were familiar faces. I now attend University of Maine and have loved every minute of it! I switched my major to marketing, and have a minor in French as well.</P>

			 <P> I live in a dorm with all transfer students, which has made the transition so much easier. It's great to have friends that are in the same situation, and my floor has become super close over the past month and a half. I think I have finally found the right school for me!</P>
