			<P>Welcome to a little bit about my life! That's me in the photo above with my Mom and Dad. We live on Cape Cod, MA where I have grown up my whole life. I am an only child, so I am very close with both of my parents! We have two dogs pictured below. My black lab, Scout, is one year old and my yellow lab, Scilla, is nine years old.</P>

			<P> The photo below is a picture I took of my favorite beach in my hometown of Sandwich, MA called The Boardwalk. This is where I spend a majority of time in the summer when I am not at work, whether I'm laying on the beach during the day or having bonfires at night with my friends. Growing up near the beach has given me a love for the ocean and has made the beach my favorite place to be.</P>
