			<P> In the summer of 2015, I attended a service learning trip with seven other students from my high school to a remote village in the Dominican Republic. I did not know at the time, but it ended up being the most rewarding and eye opening experience that I have gone through in my life up to this point. On this page, I will talk a little bit about my trip and what we accomplished.</P>

			<P>Above is a photo of the community center we helped build in the village of El Mango. The locals were so grateful that we were there to help, and were really friendly as well. We worked for seven days with the help of locals to make the floor and paint it as well. We had to level out the dirt, mix the concrete by hand, and then pour it evenly to make the floor. The work was tough and tiring, but it was a great feeling to see what we had accomplished at the end of the week!</P>

			<P>Although the week was a lot of work, we were able to have some relaxing fun at the end of the week. My classmates and I explored the city of Santiago, and got to spend a say at a beautiful beach as well!</P>
