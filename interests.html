			<P>For the past twelve years I have been a competitive figure skater, which has been my passion my whole life. I have competed on synchronized skating teams, and have had amazing opportunities in my skating career because of it. Last year I was lucky enough to have a spot on University of Delaware's synchronized skating team. We won the Regional Championships for the eighteenth year in a row, captured above, and were able to travel all around the country to compete, including at the National Championships in Illinois. Below is a picture of the first team I was on when I was seven years old.</P>

			<P>Along with figure skating, I also have a passion for skiing. I have been skiing since I was eleven years old and I learned to ski at Mount Abram and Sunday River, and now my favorite mountains are Okemo and Loon. With a love for figure skating and skiing, it's clear that I love the cold and the snow!</P>
